Things to do: 
- Don't repeat lines when rendering hex mesh (Lucas 4/20)
- Recheck all current physics code (Arjun 4/20)
- Implement stiffness matrix for a single element (Arjun 4/20)
- Assemble big stiffness matrix for entire mesh (Arjun 4/20 and Together 4/21)
- Solve linear system and update shared coordinates (Together 4/21)
